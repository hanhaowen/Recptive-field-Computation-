# Recptive-field-Computation-
Compute receptive field size in CNN

https://staging.distill.pub/2019/computing-receptiv gives us an equation to compute the receptive size along x and y axis, but their open-source code is too difficult to understand and don't support pytorch, which is not friendly with the pytorch-user. So in my code, you just need to input the network structure and the name of the layers, then you will get the answer of each layers, which is more convinent.
